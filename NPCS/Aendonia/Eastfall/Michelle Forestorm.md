- #### *Occupation*:
  Erinye, acting foreman of the [Eastfall](Fa'eldar/Kingdom%20of%20Aendonia%20-%20Settlements/Eastfall.md) mines.

- #### *Locations*:
  Can move swiftly, currently resides in the office of the [Eastfall ](Eastfall%20)Mines but originally from the third layer of [The Nine Hells](World%20&%20Information/Planes%20of%20Existence/The%20Nine%20Hells.md)

- #### *Appearance*:
  Her disguised appearance is that of a somewhat tall woman in her late 20's/early 30's with long brown hair, pale white skin and an extremely attractive wrinkeless face with deep green eyes, defined chin and a charming smile. Wearing white, green with black robes.

- #### *Bonds*:
  No real affection or care for any other creatures. Only respect and admiration for [Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells](World%20&%20Information/Deities/Asmodeus,%20the%20Lord%20of%20the%20Nine%20Hells.md), beside that only sees value in current use of creature to her. [Nicholas Embers](NPCS/Aendonia/Eastfall/Nicholas%20Embers.md) is useful right now, as is [Bergham Endwerper](NPCS/Aendonia/Aenden/Bergham%20Endwerper.md). 

- #### *Motivation*:
  Currently on a mission to reroute abyssal spawn to Myri'il instead of the first layer of hell so the Devils can a little find a bit of reprieve from the blood war and recoup their forces.  

- #### *Flaws*:
  Almost too patient. Prone to underestimate people. 
  
- #### *Assets*:
  She currently owns a small fortune which she kept from the mine which are her only valuable possessions
  
- #### *Knowledge*:
  Knows everything about what some of the devil forces are up to. Could prevent calamity just by uttering the words but she will not talk easily.
